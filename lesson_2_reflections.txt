What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing the repository creates the .git file which will keep track of all the different files statesover the life of the file.  


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows us to select the files that we want to commit to the repository and then shows uswhat will be committed.  It allows us to commit only the files that we have changed rather than everything in the repository.
